    "ChangeLog": "Version 0.9.7:\n\n [Bux Fix] Duplicating a unit with a Beyonder essence now costs pact shards again.\n\n [Bug Fix] Fixed a bug that could cause improper Beyonder run setup data to be saved to the local run history file in certain circumstances. This could cause improper setup when replaying old runs from the run history screen.\n\n [Bug Fix] When doing a quick restart, the changes to Beyonder units will now be reflected immediately in the log book. This makes it easier to reroll for certain combos.\n\n * Beyonder champions are no longer flagged as banner units.\n\n * Balance changes: Tweaked the base stats of the uncommon-tier banner units, reducing base stats and adding stat boosts to the randomized starting upgrades. This increases the variance and improves essences. Soundless Swarm and Formless Horror have more stats overall while Furry Beholder and Malevolence have less. The randomized upgrades that scale off Mania now also apply Formless or Soundless, making them easier to use.",
