    "ChangeLog": "Version 0.9.5:\n\n * Bug fix: The 'replay run' button will no longer randomize starting classes if they were originally randomized.\n\n * Rephrased the description of the 'Black Light' artifact to help clarify its effects.\n\n * Slightly reduced 'Seizure's' scaling damage from 30 per Mania to 25.\n\n * Updated status effects to make icons visible. Added some VFX effects as well.\n\n * Added new Mutator 'Petty Vengeance.' This adds a Vengeful Shard to the deck after each battle.\n\n * Added new Mutator 'Madness Within.' This makes all cards Manic during battle, but adds some Beyonder cards to help make use of this.\n\n * Tweaked how the localization of unit essences is handled to allow for better optimization.\n\n * Fixed a typo in the tutorial text.\n\n * Added tooltip icons for Anxiety and Hysteria unit triggers.\n\n * Cost adjustments from the randomized unit essences now also effect X cost units.\n\n * The Cave of a Thousand Eyes grows restless. Find them in the wild, or recruit them with the 'Restless Beast' mutator or 'Truest Champion' expert challenge.",
